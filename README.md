# MeaxisNetwork Launcher
The MeaxisNetwork Launcher for MeaxisNetwork apps.

### How to Install?
Please go through our official installation setup at https://meaxisnetwork.net/launcher/

### Is this code different from the code on the official page?
No, it isn't.

### Some of the code is deprecated, isn't it?
Yes, some of the code was scripted around 2 months ago... and was scheduled to release around 10 days after I learnt that `request` is getting deprecated, therefore, I didn't rescript the entire thing.

### Why did you use a home-made setup and not something like SquirrelSetup?
1) Not available on Linux
2) Didn't know it even existed

### Can I add apps to the MeaxisNetwork Launcher?
Yes you can! Visit our developers page at https://meaxisnetwork.net/launcher to learn more.
